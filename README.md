  ## Installation
  This project used node and requires the inquirer package. Run `npm i` in the main directory to install the necessary tools.

  Enter `node index` into the terminal to initiate the application. Follow the prompts until you finish. The resulting `index.html` and `style.css` pages will be generated in the `dist` directory.
  

  

  ## Testing
  I used jest to test this application. If you want to test the functionality of the objects created in this app, you can view the existing tests in the `__tests__` directory and use `npm test` in the ternimal to run them. It will work as long as you have already installed everything as per the Installation instructions above; otherwise you can install jest manually.
